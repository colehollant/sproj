* Project Stages (maybe?)
  1. Random replacement:
     * Feed in a body of text, set some probability of word replacement, switch a word
  2. Bayesian replacement:
     * Gather >= 2 categories, gather some probabilities of words belonging to a category (we will ignore words not in my thesaurus, but maybe write them to a file?), calculate probs of word being used given each category, replace with word if prob of belonging to the other category is greater (or lesser)
  3. Neural Network replacement:
     * IDK IDK IDK IDK IDK IDK I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING
     * How do i label ANYTHING???
     * I'm confused
     * What even is an lstm (or even an rnn LOL)
     * it's cortains 4 me
     * What if I don't even do this?? Can i just stay with naive bayes? Can I just do rf or some shit? I'm already gonna work out the probability stuff
     * Consider kmc !!!! gotta pretend i care about linalg and separatrices or whatever
     * i only kno what a tensor is in my noggin
