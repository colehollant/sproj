# IRB Proposal

[BARD IRB](https://www.bard.edu/irb/faq/)
[Certs](http://www.bard.edu/irb/train_cert/)

Maybe have to do a training?

## Basic Info

Project Title: Shifting Tone of a Body of Text

### Principle Investigator

Will be used for senior project (results in "thesis" paper)
No money needed

## Review Category and Justification

(Tests), (Surveys), Interviews, Observation of Public behavior

## Research Question and Design

Research Question:
Can words and/or phrases be modified in text to alter underlying tone but preserve meaning?

Research Design:
This will entail several (20-30) students undergoing rudimentary reading comprehension tests. There will be passages that are unaltered and ones that have been modified algorithmically with the intent of changing the tone and keeping meaning. Subjects will be asked to read each passage, and take an associated survey. The surveys for the original passages will ask for the reader's interpretation of the meaning and a 5 point ranking of the tone for each category (joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation. Positive, negative). The surveys for the altered passages will have both these sections as well as scores for how well meaning was preserved and how natural/human the passage felt.

Research Procedures:
I will hold several testing dates over the course of Spring 2020 (likely from March to April). Each participant will be asked to read an original passage fill out a survey, and then read an altered version of that passage and fill out a survey. This will be repeated as little as twice, and up to five times depending on the will of the participant. The survey will be distributed online (through Google Forms), the original passages will come from practice reading comprehension tests, and the altered versions will result from putting them through our model to alter the contents. 

This will take place at Bard College in RKC 107. The withdrawal procedure takes form in the participants either not signing the informed consent form or asking for their results to not be included (either in a survey question, or in person at the time of collection).


Target Population:
This will be targetting students at Bard College, likely within the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. This will target english speakers as per the content of the project. This will mostly involve students from age 18-22.


Recruitment Procedures:
I will send emails to the Mathematics and Computer Science departments, as well as putting up flyers.
Perhaps there will be monetary incentive ($5 maybe?)

Research Site:
This will take place in RKC 107 at Bard College.


Informed Consent:
I will enter the room, introduce myself and the project. I will discuss the testing procedure including time alloted, overview of surveys, and withdrawal procedure. Then I will hand out informed consent forms which must be signed and dated and returned to me. All participants will be 18 or older to provide consent on their own. No images, videos, etc will be shown.
