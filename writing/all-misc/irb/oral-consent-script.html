<p>Thank you for participating in this study! This survey will take no longer than 30 minutes, but you are free to leave at any point during the experiment. You will be asked to read two groups of 12 sentences and provide scores for how natural the passage sounded, as well as how angry, fearful, joyful, and sad the passage was. Before beginning the survey, please read and complete the Informed Consent Form. If you have any questions regarding the consent process, any items on the consent form, or any questions during the experiment, please feel free to ask me.</p>
<p>A copy of the consent form is provided for you to take with you.</p>
