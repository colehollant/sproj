Hello!

My name is Cole Hollant, I'm a senior in math and computer science, and I'm looking for participants for my sproj survey! It consists of reading and scoring several sentences on readability and emotion-correlation. It will take place in the beginning of April in the RKC labs. 

If you are interested, please contact me at ch1461@bard.edu. All participants may enter a lottery for one of three $25 Amazon gift cards.

Thank you so much,
Cole
