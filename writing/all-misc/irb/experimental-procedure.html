        <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>Before beginning the survey, the participant must complete a consent form. Then they will take the ground truth survey, and then take either the control survey or the experimental survey.</p>
<h2 id="ground-truth-survey">Ground Truth Survey</h2>
<p>The ground truth survey will consist of 12 sentences that were gathered from a <a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php">random sentence generator</a>. These 12 sentences will be given to all participants. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.</p>
<h2 id="control-survey">Control Survey</h2>
<p>For this section, each sentence from the previous section will be fed through a word replacement model to randomly replace words with their synonyms. Participants will answer the same questions for each sentence as in the ground-truth section. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-survey">Experimental Survey</h2>
<p>For this section, each sentence from the previous section will be fed through a word replacement model to target an emotion (either anger, fear, joy, or sadness). Participants will answer the same questions for each sentence as in the ground-truth section. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.</p>
