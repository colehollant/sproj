**Researcher:** Cole Hollant

**Faculty Advisors:** Stefan Méndez-Diez, Kerri-Ann Norton, Robert McGrail

## Consent Form
I am a student at Bard College conducting research for my senior project in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am looking into automated tone analysis for text with respect to the basic human emotions of Robert Plutchik's wheel (joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation).

In this study, you will be asked to read and complete a questionaire for a number of passages. You will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following emotions: anger, fear, joy, and sadness. The study will take place in an empty lab at Bard College, and will take no longer than 30 minutes.

There is no more risk in this study than that of everyday life. There are no direct benefits for participation other than gaining experience in experimental process. As compensation for your time, you can be entered into a lottery for one of three $25 Amazon gift cards.

Participation in this study is voluntary, and if you wish to leave the experiment while it is taking place or to ignore questions, you may do so at any time. Please inform the researcher if you choose to withdraw yourself; in the case of withdrawal, your answers will not be collected and any lottery entry will remain valid. If any questions arise during the experiment, the researcher will answer them to the best of her ability.

All responses to questionnaires and data associated with this study will remain confidential. All data and responses will be solely connected to a randomly generated unique participant ID number. There will be no link, digital or otherwise, connecting your name and email to your participant ID. Any information published from this experiment will not make it possible to identify you as a participant, however the researcher may be required to surrender data under court order.
