## Procedure

Before beginning the survey, the participant must complete a consent form. Then they will take the ground truth survey, and then take either the control survey or the experimental survey.

## Ground Truth Survey

The ground truth survey will consist of 12 sentences that were gathered from a [random sentence generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php). These 12 sentences will be given to all participants. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.

## Control Survey

For this section, each sentence from the previous section will be fed through a word replacement model to randomly replace words with their synonyms. Participants will answer the same questions for each sentence as in the ground-truth section. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.

## Experimental Survey

For this section, each sentence from the previous section will be fed through a word replacement model to target an emotion (either anger, fear, joy, or sadness). Participants will answer the same questions for each sentence as in the ground-truth section. The participant will be asked to give a score from 1-10 on how natural the passage sounded and to give scores from 1-10 on the strength of association between the passage and each of the following categories: anger, fear, joy, and sadness.
